/**
 * Domain capability profiles — domain-aware "inherited documents" for the OMK
 * control plane.
 *
 * OMK ships role-based loadouts (`loadouts.ts`: inspect/plan/code/test/review/
 * security/package-maintainer/none). This module adds an orthogonal, **domain**
 * layer: each domain profile is a curated capability bundle (skills + MCP +
 * hooks + tool gate + authority + command mode) tuned for one class of work,
 * plus a very detailed English `routingPrompt` and deterministic `triggers`
 * used by `domain-router.ts` to pick the right bundle for an incoming task.
 *
 * A `DomainProfile` is a `LoadoutProfile` augmented with routing metadata, so it
 * composes with the existing `applyLoadoutProfile()` runtime: the router selects
 * a domain, the domain profile gates which skills/MCP/hooks are active, and the
 * caller still picks the role authority. This keeps the new layer purely
 * additive — no existing loadout behavior changes.
 *
 * This module is I/O-free and side-effect-free. All resource names (skills,
 * MCP servers, hooks) reference canonical identifiers discovered by
 * `resource-loader.ts`, `mcp-inventory.ts`, and `hook-inventory.ts`.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript only (no enum/namespace/parameter properties).

Prioritize visual craft, correct component composition, and accessibility.

SEQUENCE:
1. Read the target component(s)/page(s) in full before editing. Do not edit blind from search snippets.
2. Identify the design system in use (Tailwind v4 / shadcn/ui / CSS modules / vanilla). Match it exactly; never introduce a second system. Use context7 for current framework/library docs before changing unfamiliar APIs.
3. Website clone / visual QA work follows the ai-website-cloner-template gate contract:
   Reconnaissance -> Design-Token Foundation -> Component Specs -> Asset Gate -> Build Gate -> QA Gate.
   Reconnaissance uses Chrome/Playwright: chrome-devtools first for live inspection, playwright when deterministic multi-viewport screenshots or scripted interaction sweeps are needed. Capture screenshots at responsive sizes 1440/768/390, getComputedStyle design-token samples, assets, page topology, hover/click/scroll/time-driven behavior, and responsive breakpoints.
4. Design-Token Foundation is sequential: fonts, oklch/shadcn-compatible tokens, global CSS, page-level motion primitives, icon extraction, downloaded assets, and typed content structures. Do not dispatch component builders until the foundation exists.
5. Component Specs are contracts: component-spec-before-build requires a spec artifact before implementation. Specs include exact getComputedStyle values, DOM structure, interaction model, all states, assets, verbatim content, and responsive behavior. Split anything whose builder prompt would exceed ~150 lines.
6. Asset Gate: real extractable assets are downloaded, named, and referenced before build; no mock assets when source assets are available.
7. Build Gate: one builder per section or sub-component receives the full spec inline plus screenshot path, target file, imports, breakpoint behavior, and a typecheck/build requirement. Assembly wires sections into page-level layout and behaviors.
8. QA Gate: visual-diff-after-edit requires side-by-side visual diff artifacts against the reference at 1440/768/390. Test interactions with Chrome/Playwright; run web-quality-audit for perf/a11y/SEO/best-practices and typecheck-after-edit before done.
9. Evidence must include screenshots, getComputedStyle captures, responsive sizes 1440/768/390, side-by-side visual diff artifacts, Chrome/Playwright command/tool results, changed files, and known discrepancies.
10. Accessibility: run the fixing-accessibility + contrast-checker + use-of-color skills. Every interactive element needs a reachable name, visible focus, and AA contrast.
11. Motion: prefer the transitions-dev / animate / 12-principles-of-animation skills; gate heavy effects behind fix-motion-performance so animation never blocks the main thread.
12. Prefer composition over boolean-prop sprawl (vercel-composition-patterns). Keep components small and spec-driven.

HARD RULES: no inline styles when a token/utility exists; oklch tokens for color; mobile-first responsive; real content over placeholders; pixel-match the target first, customize later; no visual claim without bounded screenshot/diff evidence.`,

This domain carries the ai-website-cloner-template workflow inside OMK loadouts without copying its project scaffold.
Pipeline: Reconnaissance -> Design-Token Foundation -> Component Specs -> Asset Gate -> Build Gate -> QA Gate.

SEQUENCE:
1. Pre-flight: browser automation is required. Prefer Chrome/Playwright: chrome-devtools for live inspection, playwright for deterministic screenshot, viewport, and interaction replay. Use context7 for current framework and Playwright docs before coding against unfamiliar APIs.
2. Reconnaissance: capture full-page screenshots at responsive sizes 1440/768/390, getComputedStyle color/type/spacing tokens, assets, page topology, z-index/sticky overlays, scroll/click/hover/time behavior, and responsive breakpoints. Save bounded artifacts and behavior notes.
3. Design-Token Foundation: update only the target project's existing frontend foundation: fonts, globals, tokens, icon extraction, downloaded assets, typed content structures, and page-level motion primitives. Foundation is sequential.
4. Component Specs: component-spec-before-build requires one spec per section/sub-component before implementation. Specs include exact getComputedStyle values, DOM structure, all states, interaction model, assets, verbatim text, screenshots, and responsive behavior. Split specs that would create a builder prompt over ~150 lines.
5. Asset Gate: real extractable assets are downloaded, named, and referenced before build; no mock assets when source assets are available.
6. Build Gate: dispatch or implement one section/sub-component at a time from its spec; builders receive the full spec inline, not a pointer. Require typecheck-after-edit and the target project's build/smoke command before merging/assembling.
7. QA Gate: wire sections into page layout, then visual-diff-after-edit requires side-by-side visual diff artifacts against the reference at 1440/768/390. Re-test scroll, hover, click, tab, carousel, modal, and animation behavior with Chrome/Playwright.
8. Evidence: bounded-evidence records screenshots, getComputedStyle captures, responsive sizes 1440/768/390, side-by-side visual diff paths, Chrome/Playwright command/tool results, changed files, known discrepancies, and any remaining fidelity gaps.

HARD RULES: no guessed CSS values; no builder without a spec artifact; no mock assets when real assets are extractable; no completion claim without visual diff evidence; general Playwright test failures without visual/reconstruction intent stay in qa-testing.`,

Use OMK skills, MCP, and hooks to orchestrate rhwp-style capability without vendoring Rust, WASM, or CLI binaries into the repo.

SEQUENCE:
1. Detection first: identify HWP/HWPX by extension plus container sniffing. HWP is normally OLE Compound File Binary; HWPX is normally ZIP/XML package content. Never trust extension alone. Record filename, byte size, hash, detected format, and whether the file appears encrypted/protected.
2. Load current docs with context7 before coding against @rhwp/core, rhwp APIs, pdf rendering packages, or browser automation APIs. Use project-installed tools when present; do not add or vendor rhwp Rust/WASM/CLI artifacts unless the user explicitly requests dependency work.
3. Extraction path: produce bounded text and markdown outputs, structured metadata, section/page outline, tables, images/assets references, equations/charts notes, and warnings for unsupported controls. Keep private document content bounded: short excerpts, counts, hashes, and output paths rather than dumping whole documents.
4. Render path: use rhwp-oriented skills for layout/page fidelity. Use chrome-devtools/playwright only to render or capture web/WASM/canvas/SVG views that already exist in the project. Capture SVG/page snapshots and PNG evidence with viewport/page labels.
5. Export path: support text, markdown, svg, png, and pdf outputs. Prefer native/project export APIs when available; otherwise assemble via browser-rendered SVG/canvas/PDF flows. Always write artifacts to an explicit output directory and report a manifest.
6. Metadata path: collect page count, section count, dimensions, fonts, embedded images, tables, headers/footers, footnotes/endnotes, equations/charts, fields, protection/encryption status, and conversion warnings.
7. Evidence: bounded-evidence and document-artifact-guard require an artifact manifest containing input hash, detected format, commands/tools used, output paths, output byte sizes, page/sample counts, warnings, and at most small redacted excerpts. stop-verify must pass before done.

HARD RULES: no vendored rhwp binaries; no fake conversion claims; no full private document dump in chat; output artifacts must be traceable; every render/export claim needs bounded evidence.`,

SEQUENCE:
1. Read the affected route/controller/service/repo and the schema in full first.
2. For data changes: prefer the database-migrations skill (additive + backfill + expand/contract); never destructive in a single step. Validate with the framework verification skill (django-verification / laravel-verification / springboot-verification).
3. Query work: apply postgres-patterns / supabase-postgres-best-practices (indexes, EXPLAIN, RLS). ClickHouse analytics use clickhouse-io.
4. API shape: api-design skill for resource naming, status codes, pagination, error envelopes, versioning.
5. Integrating LLMs: claude-api / codex-api skills for correct model ids, streaming, tool use, caching. Building an MCP server: mcp-server-patterns + mcp-build-mcp.
6. Language idiom: use the matching *-patterns skill (python/golang/rust/kotlin/perl/cpp). Type-strict, no \`any\`.
7. Security baseline: run security-review before claiming done; secrets never logged (protect-secrets hook enforces).

Prioritize correct statistical reasoning, reproducibility, and honest uncertainty.

SEQUENCE:
1. Start with exploratory-data-analysis: shape, dtypes, missingness, distributions, basic sanity checks — never skip straight to modeling.
2. Pick the dataframe engine by size: polars for in-memory speed, dask for larger-than-RAM. Do not reach for pandas by reflex.
3. Visualization: seaborn/plotly for exploration, scientific-visualization for publication figures (colorblind-safe, correct error bars, journal styling).
4. Modeling: scikit-learn for classical, pytorch-lightning for DL. State assumptions, then validate with statistical-analysis (right test, assumption checks, power). Bayesian work uses pymc; report with statsmodels.
5. Interpretability: shap for global/local explanations; do not ship a black box without them.
6. Reproducibility: fix seeds, pin versions, commit the exact data hash. Prefer scripts/functions over ad-hoc notebook cells for anything reused.

HARD RULES: report effect size + CI, not just p-values; never train on test; never impute silently; notebooks are for exploration, modules are for production.`,

2. Keep text chat flows and Imagine/media tool flows separate. Text work uses Grok chat/OAuth/provider surfaces; image/video/Imagine work routes through explicit Imagine tools only. Never conflate model ids with Imagine tool names.
3. Capability discipline: load at most 2-3 skills for any lane. The allowed skill gate is packages, headroom, programming, debugging, adaptorch-route, adaptorch-synthesize, and understand-anything; choose the smallest subset and add headroom only under context pressure.
4. Adaptorch is advisory only. Use adaptorch-route for routing/decomposition advice and adaptorch-synthesize for evidence synthesis, but do not treat Adaptorch as an automatic executor, source of truth, permission grant, or substitute for explicit tests.
5. Use minimal MCP: adaptorch for advice/synthesis, fetch for bounded public retrieval, understand-anything for repo comprehension, and playwright only when browser or Imagine UI behavior needs real verification.
6. Keep edits within the lane grant and preserve existing provider/orchestration algorithms unless the task explicitly targets them. Never route through legacy KIMICLI or deleted wrappers.
7. Verification: run the narrowest relevant test/typecheck after edits. Evidence must include changed paths, exact commands, and pass/fail output.

HARD RULES: grok.md is mandatory context for Grok/xAI harness work; text chat surfaces and Imagine tools are distinct; maximum 2-3 active skills; Adaptorch is advisory route/synthesis support only; never log OAuth tokens, cookies, or proxy credentials; protect-secrets applies.`,

		routingPrompt: `DOMAIN: AI Agent Engineering & Ops. You are operating in an agent-systems capability lane.
Prioritize eval-driven design, correct context engineering, and safe autonomy.

SEQUENCE:
1. Frame the system: agentic-engineering (eval-first, decomposition, cost-aware routing) + ai-first-engineering operating model.
2. Context: context-engineering for prompt/command/skill/sub-agent construction; iterative-retrieval to solve the subagent context problem; prompt-optimizer before shipping prompts (test with a fresh subagent, RED-GREEN-REFACTOR).
3. Build artifacts: create-agent / create-skill / create-hook for the harness; mcp-builder + mcp-server-patterns for MCP servers (correct tool schemas, Zod, stdio vs HTTP).
4. Autonomy: autonomous-loops / continuous-agent-loop with quality gates + recovery; enterprise-agent-ops for long-lived workloads (observability, boundaries, lifecycle).
5. Evaluate: eval-harness + agent-eval + agent-self-evaluation — never ship an agent change without a measured eval delta. nanoclaw-repl for interactive iteration.
6. Orchestration: harness (team-architecture factory) for multi-agent topology; dispatching-parallel-agents / subagent-driven-development for parallel lanes; ralphinho-rfc-pipeline for DAG + merge queue.

HARD RULES: every agent/skill change has an eval; prompts are versioned and tested, not vibe-edited; MCP servers validate inputs; autonomy is bounded by explicit stop conditions + stop-verify hook.

PATCH SAFETY (B2C Correctness Wall): for pre-apply patch screening, load the correctness-wall extension explicitly (not in default preset). Read packages/coding-agent/docs/correctness-wall.md and examples/extensions/correctness-wall/README.md. Roll out shadow → soft → hard; never claim formal correctness proof.`,
