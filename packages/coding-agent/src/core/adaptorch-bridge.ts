/**
 * Reasoning-router AdaptOrch advisory bridge (Goal 009 Lane B).
 *
 * A default-off, advisory-only primitive for a future reasoning-router hint
 * source. This module is intentionally NOT wired into agent-session.ts; it only
 * implements the bridge's payload/result schema, sanitize/validate helpers, TTL
 * cache, budget counter, circuit breaker, and timeout wrapper around a
 * caller-injected advisory function. A future lane decides how (or whether) to
 * fuse a returned hint into a resolved ThinkingLevel and to actually call this
 * module from agent-session.ts.
 *
 * Grounded in the read-first plan at
 * .omk/goals/008-reasoning-router-advanced-accuracy-plan/laneC-privacy-adaptorch.md
 * (Part B, sections 4.1-4.11) and the real AdaptOrch MCP tool surface
 * documented in packages/adaptorch-wpl/src/adaptorch-client.ts. Key
 * constraints carried over from that plan:
 *
 *  - The router's turn-start path is synchronous and I/O-free today (plan
 *    4.4). This module never calls an MCP transport directly and exposes a
 *    synchronous, cache-read-only accessor (`getFreshHint`) plus a
 *    fire-and-forget refresh (`requestRefresh`) so a future integration can
 *    never block or await this module inline on the turn-start path.
 *  - The real, documented AdaptOrch tool surface has no confidence or
 *    reasoning-level field (plan 4.3); this module's inbound result type
 *    (`AdaptorchAdvisoryResult`) therefore only carries a locally-relevant
 *    `taskClass` and a `confidenceBand` - both closed enums - never a raw
 *    numeric confidence or a `ThinkingLevel` value. Fusing a hint into a
 *    resolved level is out of scope for this module.
 *  - No product source is imported here. `AdaptorchTaskClass` /
 *    `AdaptorchLaneType` intentionally mirror the v4 task/lane unions by
 *    value, not by import, so this bridge remains isolated until a future
 *    wiring lane deliberately connects it to the router.
 *  - Every outbound/inbound field is a closed enum, a boolean, or a bounded
 *    integer, derived from local features only. There is structurally no
 *    field shaped to carry prompt text, a prompt hash, a file/working-
 *    directory path, a model/provider identifier, a session/user identifier,
 *    a tool name, or hook output - the sanitize/validate helpers below also
 *    reject any candidate object exposing such a field by name, and reject
 *    any key outside the exact closed schema, so a hand-built or forged
 *    payload can never smuggle one through either type.
 *  - The router-bridge tool allowlist (`ADAPTORCH_READONLY_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`)
 *    only ever contains the two read/local AdaptOrch tools the plan
 *    identifies as in scope (the session-start capabilities probe and the
 *    per-consult topology-classification call, plan 4.2/4.6); the
 *    run-submission and run-cancellation tools (and any other mutating
 *    tool) can never appear in it, checked both by an exact-value test and
 *    by `looksMutatingToolName`'s verb-segment guard.
 *
 * Pure aside from `Date.now`/`setTimeout` (both injectable/wrapped so tests
 * never depend on real wall-clock time or a real MCP call).
