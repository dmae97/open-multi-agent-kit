/**
 * Shared runtime contracts used by both AgentRuntime and RuntimeAdapter.
 *
 * AgentRuntime — internal runtime implementation interface (src/runtime/agent-runtime.ts)
 *   Used by concrete runtimes (KimiApi, DeepSeek, Codex, WireProtocol, etc.)
 *   Operates on ContextCapsule and supports optional execute()/health() hooks.
 *
 * RuntimeAdapter — provider-routing interface (src/runtime/adapter.ts)
 *   Used by the provider routing layer to select and dispatch to runtimes.
 *   Operates on AgentRunRequest and requires mandatory health()/supports()/runNode().
