# OMK Agent Harness Mono Repo

This is the home of the omk agent harness project including our self extensible coding agent.

* **[open-multi-agent-kit](packages/coding-agent)**: Interactive coding agent CLI
* **[omk-agent-core](packages/agent)**: Agent runtime with tool calling and state management
* **[omk-ai](packages/ai)**: Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, …)

To learn more about omk:

* [Project demos from Mario](https://www.threads.com/@been_yg?hl=ko)
* [Read the documentation](https://omk.dev/docs/latest), but you can also ask the agent to explain itself

## OMK//CONTROL TUI

<p align="center">
  <img src="readmeasset/omk_tui.png" alt="OMK//CONTROL terminal dashboard — live DAG lanes, provider routing, MCP health, evidence gates, and telemetry in Night City Ops Console style" width="100%" />
</p>

The OMK//CONTROL startup surface is the default operator view. The header reads `omk v<package.version> · OMK//CONTROL`, using the published `open-multi-agent-kit` package version as the single source of truth.

The default dark TUI theme uses the `omk-control-grid-dark` Night City palette and keeps the control sidebar focused on route, evidence, loop, MCP, runtime, skills, and context budget state.

## Slash commands, packages, and skills (load them hard)

OMK is most useful when packages and skills are installed up front, then invoked with `/` slash commands and bang skills (`!skill:name`, `!omk-loop`).

Browse community packages at [pi.dev/packages](https://pi.dev/packages). Install into the user agent (`~/.omk/agent/settings.json`) with pinned versions for stability:

```bash
# Context + web + code intelligence
omk install npm:@hypabolic/pi-hypa@0.1.9
omk install npm:pi-web-access@0.13.0
omk install npm:pi-lens@3.8.66
omk install npm:pi-shazam@0.26.0
omk install npm:@ff-labs/pi-fff@0.9.6
omk install npm:@mrclrchtr/supi-context@2.2.1
omk install npm:@mrclrchtr/supi-web@2.2.1

# Plan / goal / task loops
omk install npm:@mjasnikovs/pi-task@0.18.4
omk install npm:@narumitw/pi-goal@0.11.0
omk install npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode@0.11.0
omk install npm:@plannotator/pi-extension@0.22.0

# Operator UX + quality
omk install npm:@ayulab/pi-rewind@0.4.4
omk install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question@1.20.0
omk install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-todo@1.20.0
omk install npm:pi-simplify@0.2.2
omk install npm:pi-powerline-footer@0.6.1

# Optional: refresh git/npm package checkouts
omk update --extensions
omk list
```

After install, open a fresh `omk` session and hammer the slash surface:

| Slash | Package | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `/plan` | `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` | Read-only plan collaboration mode |
| `/goal` | `@narumitw/pi-goal` | Keep working a goal until marked complete |
| `/task`, `/task-list`, `/task-resume` | `@mjasnikovs/pi-task` | Crash-safe task pipeline with verify gates |
| `/plannotator`, `/plannotator-review` | `@plannotator/pi-extension` | Interactive plan / PR annotation review |
| `/rewind`, `/checkpoint`, `/tree` | `@ayulab/pi-rewind` | Checkpoint navigation |
| `/todos` | `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo` | Live todo overlay |
| `/hypa` | `@hypabolic/pi-hypa` | Hypa context compression diagnostics |
| `/simplify` | `pi-simplify` | Review recent edits for clarity |
| `/supi-context` | `@mrclrchtr/supi-context` | Context usage report |
| `/fff-health`, `/fff-rescan` | `@ff-labs/pi-fff` | Fuzzy file/content search health |
| `/shazam-doctor` | `pi-shazam` | Structural codebase awareness doctor |
| `/powerline` | `pi-powerline-footer` | Status bar controls |
| `/think auto` | built-in | Automatic reasoning-effort routing (v4) |

Skills ecosystem (in addition to OMK-native packs):

```bash
# Discover
npx skills find "plan review"
npx skills find "react performance"

# Install globally (user-level), skip prompts
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-optimize -g -y -a '*'
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-view-transitions -g -y -a '*'
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill writing-guidelines -g -y -a '*'

# Enable / disable package resources in the TUI
omk config
```

Inside OMK, prefer **minimum necessary skills per turn** (usually 1–3). Load heavy packs on demand with bang syntax, for example `!omk-loop`, `!skill:programming`, `!skill:debugging`. Do not bulk-load the entire catalog into every session — that burns context without improving routing.

Hypa (optional, pairs with `@hypabolic/pi-hypa`):

```bash
hypa init --global --agent pi
hypa doctor
```

## Release v0.90.6

This release documents the operator package/slash loadout (with the omkgirl hero asset), lands the experimental B2C Correctness Wall and Grok OAuth harness wiring, and continues the v4 reasoning-router generalization track.

| Area | What changed |
|------|--------------|
| Docs / loadout | Root README now documents pinned pi.dev package installs, slash-command map, and skills.sh install flow; added `readmeasset/omkgirl.png`. |
| Correctness Wall | Experimental B2C Correctness Wall extension with soft/hard/shadow modes; evidence-gated advisory evaluation only. |
| Grok harness | Grok OAuth domain profile, playbook auto-apply, `grok-4.5` compaction preference, Imagine chat-model rejection on completion paths. |
| Extension host | `callMcpTool` bind path for extensions at load time. |
| Reasoning router | Table-driven intent clusters + normalize module and governed held-out generalization gate. |

GitHub-focused release notes live in [.github/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.90.6.md](.github/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.90.6.md). The GitHub release workflow also extracts the canonical release body from [packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md](packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md).

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use OMK or other coding agents for open source work, publish sanitized sessions from `.omk/agent/sessions`.

Public OSS session data helps improve coding agents with real-world tasks, tool use, failures, and fixes instead of toy benchmarks.

## All Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[omk-ai](packages/ai)** | Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) |
| **[omk-agent-core](packages/agent)** | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |
| **[open-multi-agent-kit](packages/coding-agent)** | Interactive coding agent CLI |
| **[omk-tui](packages/tui)** | Terminal UI library with differential rendering |

For Slack/chat automation and workflow integrations, use OMK extensions and MCP servers.

## Adaptorch MCP integration

[AdaptOrch MCP](https://adaptorch.ai.kr) is a separate, proprietary reliability-kernel service (not part of
this monorepo) that OMK can route orchestration tasks through: topology-aware DAG routing, multi-model
synthesis, and consistency verification. It is versioned `0.1.0` — an MVP stage — with a public-ready free
Starter tier and paid Pro/Team tiers, and is backed by a published paper
([arXiv:2602.16873](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16873)).

The `adaptorch` and `adaptorch-prod` MCP servers plus the `adaptorch-route` and `adaptorch-synthesize` skills
ship in OMK's default `omk-core-verified` execution preset, so they are available from the first prompt of a
default session without extra setup. Actually invoking AdaptOrch (e.g. `adaptorch_run`) still requires an
`ADAPTORCH_CONTROL_PLANE_TOKEN` (a dev token is auto-set for a local control plane at `127.0.0.1:8000`) and
follows normal task-routing rules rather than firing on every message.

This is distinct from `packages/adaptorch-wpl` in this monorepo, an experimental, design-stage Work Packet
Loop package that is not yet wired into the `open-multi-agent-kit` CLI — see that package's own README for its
current status.

## Permissions & Containerization

OMK does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox OMK. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **OpenShell**: run the whole `omk` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.
- **Gondolin extension**: keep `omk` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `omk` process in a local container for simple isolation.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project-specific rules (for both humans and agents).

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run check        # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./omk-test.sh        # Run OMK from sources (can be run from any directory)
```

## Supply-chain hardening

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `OMK_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent shrinkwrap.
- The published CLI package includes `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps for npm users.
- Release smoke tests use `npm run release:local` to build, pack, and create isolated npm and Bun installs outside the repo before tagging a release.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `omk update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
- CI installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and a scheduled GitHub workflow runs `npm audit --omit=dev` plus `npm audit signatures --omit=dev`.
- Shrinkwrap generation has an explicit allowlist for dependency lifecycle scripts; new lifecycle-script deps fail checks until reviewed.
